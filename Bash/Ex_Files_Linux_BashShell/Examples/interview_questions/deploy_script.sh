# You can use a shell script to 
# automate tasks like pulling code from a repository, building the project, and deploying it to a 
# server. Here's a general outline of how you could structure such a shell script: 

REPO_URL="https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git"
TARGET_DIR="/path/to/deployment/directory"
BRANCH="main"
BUILD_DIR="/path/to/build/directory"

# Update the code from the repo
echo "Updating code from the repository..."
cd "$TARGET_DIR" || exit  #if the directory change fails the script will exist
git pull origin "$BRANCH"

# Build the project (if needed)
echo "Building the project...."
cd "$BUILD_DIR" || exit
# insert the build commands

#Deploy the project
echo "Deploying the project..."
# Insert deployment commands here

echo "Deployment complete!"
