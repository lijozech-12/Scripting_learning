##  top â€“ Monitor System Processes

The `top` command is a powerful tool in Linux for monitoring system performance and troubleshooting issues. It provides a real-time view of system processes, including CPU and memory usage, and allows you to manage processes directly from the command line. Here are some practical use cases, examples, and arguments for using the `top` command:

### Basic Usage

1. **Start `top`**:
   ```bash
   top
   ```
   This command starts the `top` utility, displaying a real-time view of system processes.

### Key Metrics Displayed by `top`

- **Uptime and Load Average**: Shows how long the system has been running and the average load on the CPU over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
- **Tasks**: Displays the number of running, sleeping, stopped, and zombie processes.
- **CPU Usage**: Shows the percentage of CPU time spent on user processes, system processes, and idle time.
- **Memory Usage**: Displays the total, used, and free memory and swap space.

### Practical Use Cases

1. **Identifying High CPU Usage**:
   - **Scenario**: You notice that your system is running slowly and want to identify which processes are consuming the most CPU.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     top
     ```
     - Look at the `%CPU` column to identify processes with high CPU usage.
     - Press `P` to sort processes by CPU usage.

2. **Monitoring Memory Usage**:
   - **Scenario**: You want to monitor memory usage to ensure that your system is not running out of memory.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     top
     ```
     - Look at the `RES` and `%MEM` columns to see the memory usage of each process.
     - Press `M` to sort processes by memory usage.

3. **Killing a Process**:
   - **Scenario**: You need to terminate a process that is causing issues.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     top
     ```
     - Find the process ID (PID) of the process you want to kill.
     - Press `k`, enter the PID, and confirm to kill the process.

4. **Filtering Processes by User**:
   - **Scenario**: You want to view processes owned by a specific user.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     top -u username
     ```
     - Replace `username` with the name of the user whose processes you want to view.

### Useful Arguments and Options

1. **Display Specific User's Processes**:
   ```bash
   top -u username
   ```
   This command displays only the processes owned by the specified user.

2. **Batch Mode Operation**:
   ```bash
   top -b -n 1
   ```
   This command runs `top` in batch mode, which is useful for scripting and logging. The `-n 1` option specifies that `top` should update only once and then exit.

3. **Set Refresh Interval**:
   ```bash
   top -d 5
   ```
   This command sets the refresh interval to 5 seconds.

4. **Highlight Running Tasks**:
   ```bash
   top -z
   ```
   This command highlights running tasks.
